# silver-octo-NodeJSBack
the backend of silver-octo uses mySQL data base and rest api.
receives api requests from silver-octo-reactFront and returns products and user information.

The reason as to which silver-octo is designed in such way is(separated in two repos) is that at the time of designe i had the store based on netlify hosting. The backend started as separate project i didn't want the initial startup delay on the heroku servers so this will be the version until or when i decide tho reconfigure the source codes into one.
